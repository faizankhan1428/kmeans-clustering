# ML Exercise 10 - KMeans Clustering

This notebook demonstrates **unsupervised learning** using **K-Means clustering** on synthetic data with clear cluster structures.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:
- Generate synthetic 2D cluster data
- Apply KMeans with 4 clusters
- Visualize discovered clusters and centroids

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Understand how KMeans partitions data
- Learn how to select the number of clusters
- See the effect of initialization and randomness

### 🚀 Extensions:
- Try `n_clusters=3` or `5`
- Use elbow method or silhouette score
- Apply to real datasets (e.g., Iris, Digits)
